# Phising-URL-Classification-using-Ensemble-Model
This project detects phishing URLs using a high-performance Stacking Ensemble (XGBoost + MLP) optimized for GPU. By combining robust lexical features with Sentence-BERT (SBERT) embeddings, the model achieves superior accuracy in identifying malicious links.
